I lose control because of you babe
I lose control when you look at me like this
There's something in your eyes
That is saying tonight
I'm not child anymore
Life has opened the door
To a new exciting life

I lose control
When I'm close to you babe
I lose control
Don't look at me like this
There's something in your eyes
Is this love at first sight
Like a flower that grows
Life just want that you to know
All the secrets of life

It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now
forever and a day

I lose control because of you babe
I lose control
Don't look at me like this
There's something in your eyes
That is saying tonight
I'm so curious for more
Just like never before
In my innocent life

It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now
forever and a day

Time stand still
When the days of innocence
Are falling for the night
I love you girl
I always will
I swear I'm there for you
Till the day I die

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now
forever and a day
